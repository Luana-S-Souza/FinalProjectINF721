# Final Project INF 721

## Description

This project is the final assignment for INF 721. The main objective is to develop a transformer model based on a chosen article.The model proposed in the article, called TransPolymer, is a Transformer-based model designed for accurate prediction of polymer properties, marking the first application of such models to polymer science. The goal is to address challenges in representing polymers, such as their complex structures and the variability in polymerization. By using SMILES sequences of repeating polymer units along with structural descriptors, the model effectively captures essential features for property prediction. Unlike previous models, TransPolymer
leverages the attention mechanism of the Transformer to understand intricate relationships between molecular components, even when certain structural information is not explicitly provided.
